What is an operator? An operator is a Kubernetes custom controller which extends the native K8s API.
Operators were developed to handle sophisticated, stateful applications that the default K8s controllers aren’t able to handle. While stock Kubernetes controllers—for example, StatefulSets—are ideal for deploying, maintaining and scaling simple stateless applications, they are not equipped to handle access to stateful resources, upgrade, resize and backup of more elaborate, clustered applications such as databases.</description></item></channel></rss>
