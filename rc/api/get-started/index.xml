Note: The Redis Cloud REST API is available only to Flexible or Annual subscriptions. It is not supported for Fixed or Free subscriptions. For security reasons, the Redis Cloud API is disabled by default.
To enable the API:
Sign in to your Redis Cloud subscription as an account owner.</description></item><item><title>Manage API keys</title><link>/rc/api/get-started/manage-api-keys/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/rc/api/get-started/manage-api-keys/</guid><description>Every REST API request must include the following API keys:
The Account key identifies the account associated with the Redis Enterprise Cloud subscription.
The User key identifies the user and (optionally) the context of a request. Generated by account owners.
Use the API Keys tab of the Access Management screen to manage your keys:
Sign in to your Redis Cloud subscription as an account owner.
From the menu, choose Access Management and then select the API Keys tab.</description></item><item><title>Use the REST API</title><link>/rc/api/get-started/use-rest-api/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/rc/api/get-started/use-rest-api/</guid><description>You can access and use the API endpoint URI (https://api.redislabs.com/v1) with any of the following tools:
The Swagger user interface The cURL HTTP client An HTTP client in any programming language Swagger user interface The Swagger UI is useful for initial introduction and for learning about API operations, models, and simulated usage.
Authenticate to Swagger To authenticate to the Swagger UI:
Open the Swagger UI page in a browser.
Select Authorize.</description></item><item><title>Manage API tasks</title><link>/rc/api/get-started/manage-tasks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/rc/api/get-started/manage-tasks/</guid><description>A task is an API operation that is performed asynchronously because it exceeds the time allowed for the synchronous request/response model.
Examples of API operations that use tasks are:
create subscription create database update database delete database All create, update, and delete API operations (POST, PUT, and DELETE) and some query operations (GET) use tasks.
After you request an asynchronous operation, the operation returns a taskId that identities the specific task, and contains contextual and status data on the API operation performed by the task.</description></item><item><title>The API request lifecycle</title><link>/rc/api/get-started/process-lifecycle/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/rc/api/get-started/process-lifecycle/</guid><description>Flexible and Annual Redis Enterprise Cloud subscriptions can leverage a RESTful API that permits operations against a variety of resources, including servers, services, and related infrastructure.
Note: The REST API is not supported for Fixed or Free subscriptions. Once it&amp;rsquo;s enabled, you can use the REST API to create, update, and delete subscriptions, databases, and other entities.
API operations run asynchronously, which means that provisioning occurs in the background. When you submit a request, a background process starts working on it.</description></item></channel></rss>
