Sending logs to a remote logging server Redis Enterprise sends logs to syslog by default. You can send these logs to a remote logging server by configuring syslog.
To do this, modify the syslog or rsyslog configuration on your operating system to send logs in /var/opt/redislabs/log to a remote monitoring server of your choice.</description></item><item><title>View Redis slow log</title><link>/rs/clusters/logging/redis-slow-log/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/rs/clusters/logging/redis-slow-log/</guid><description>On the Database &amp;gt; Slow Log page, you can view Slow Log details for Redis Enterprise Software (RS) databases.
Redis Slow Log is one of the best tools for debugging and tracing your Redis database, especially if you experience high latency and high CPU usage with Redis operations. Because Redis is based on a single threaded architecture, Redis Slow Log can be much more useful than slow log mechanisms of multi-threaded database systems such as MySQL Slow Query Log.</description></item></channel></rss>
