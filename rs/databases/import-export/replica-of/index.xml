To create a replica connection, you define a database as a replica of a source database. Replica Of databases (also known as Active-Passive databases) synchronize in the background.
Sources databases can be:
Located in the same Redis Enterprise Software cluster Located in a different Redis Enterprise cluster Hosted by a different deployment, e.</description></item><item><title>Replica Of Repeatedly Fails</title><link>/rs/databases/import-export/replica-of/replicaof-repeatedly-fails/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/rs/databases/import-export/replica-of/replicaof-repeatedly-fails/</guid><description>Problem: The Replica Of process repeatedly fails and restarts
Diagnostic: A log entry in the Redis log of the source database shows repeated failures and restarts.
Cause: The Redis &amp;ldquo;client-output-buffer-limit&amp;rdquo; setting on the source database is configured to a relatively small value, which causes the connection drop.
Resolution: Reconfigure the buffer on the source database to a bigger value:
If the source is a Redis database on a Redis Enterprise Software cluster, increase the replica buffer size of the source database with:</description></item></channel></rss>
