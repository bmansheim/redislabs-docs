But what does the performance look like as compared to a memory-only database, one stored solely in RAM?
These scenarios use the memtier_benchmark utility to evaluate the performance of a Redis Enterprise Software deployment, including the trial version.
The memtier_benchmark utility is located in /opt/redislabs/bin/ of Redis Enterprise Software deployments.</description></item><item><title>Terminology in Redis Enterprise Software</title><link>/rs/references/terminology/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/rs/references/terminology/</guid><description>Here are explanations of some of the terms used in Redis Enterprise Software.
