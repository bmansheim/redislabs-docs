Minimum Redis compatibility version (database): 4.0.0 Minimum Redis Enterprise Software version (cluster): 5.0.0 RediSearch 1.1.0 (April 2018) This is a major version (we almost named it 2.0), which includes months of work, mostly on the brand new aggregations engine.
Aggregations Aggregations are a way to process the results of a search query, group, sort and transform them - and extract analytic insights from them. Much like aggregation queries in other databases and search engines, they can be used to create analytics report, or to perform Faceted Search style queries.</description></item><item><title>RediSearch 1.0 release notes</title><link>/modules/redisearch/release-notes/redisearch-1.0-release-notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/modules/redisearch/release-notes/redisearch-1.0-release-notes/</guid><description>Requirements RediSearch v1.0.10 requires:
